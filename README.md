# Digital Systems Laboratory experiments
This is the repository for the final project of the Introduction to Digital Computer Systems Laboratory class.

A digital ruler was built using the **HC-SR04** sensor togheter with the FRDM-KL25z microcontroller.

During the execution of the main function the user is prompted through the terminal window to insert the desired distance to be measured.
The program then displays the current distance in a LCD display and warns the user once the desired distance is found.
